                My SIP is to do with mindsculptor with James Rogers. We are building an automated Red vs Blue environment for people wanting to test out theirs skills without having to deal with the trouble of setting up everything themselves.
                The team members of my SIP are Jace Alexander(me) and James Rogers. Mind Sculptor piece of software that is able to configure a network of computers to be vulnerable to different attacks on a network while also managing the look and feel of the virtual machines to allow for people to feel like they are in a live fire environment.
