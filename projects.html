                As a project I had to make a script that would output a check of your server health and what is on the server. The people that worked on this project was just me.

               I was very interested in steganography when I first got into this school along with python scripting. So, I thought that combining the 2 would be the best way of going on around it. I made my own basic stego script that can hide data within the image of your choosing using least sigification bit shifts.
               For team members it was only me on this.
