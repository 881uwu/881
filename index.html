            Hello everyone, welcome to my protfolio webpage!! I am Jace Alexander my major here at UAT is Network Security and this is my page of proof of work through UAT. 

            I was a member of CCDC as the lead firewall/router user. While also being on OSINT and pentesting for the CPTC team.

            While at this school I really learned a lot through the project and classes I have been apart of. This is what I have worked through and hope that works well for you all. thank you for visiting my page and can't wait to see what the future holds in store!
            
            My SIP is to do with mindsculptor with James Rogers. We are building an automated Red vs Blue environment for people wanting to test out theirs skills without having to deal with the trouble of setting up everything themselves.
